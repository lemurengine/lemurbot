std-gossip,"WHAT IS GOSSIP",,,"<br/>Gossip is an interesting ""learning"" feature of AIML.  The best way to <br/>illustrate the gossip function is with an example.   Consider the<br/>category with the pattern ""I * "" and the template:<br/><br/>Thanks for the gossip: <br/>&lt;gossip&gt;&lt;getname/&gt; said &lt;get_gender/&gt; &lt;person2/&gt; &lt;/gossip&gt;.<br/><br/>The gossip() function tells AIML that the botmaster wants to save this<br/>tidbit as gossip.  The &lt;get_gender/&gt; function returns ""he"" or ""she"" as<br/>determined by the markup functions &lt;set_female&gt; and &lt;set_male/&gt;. <br/>The &lt;person2/&gt; function converts the statement * to second person.<br/>At present the robot stores the gossip collected in a file called<br/>""gossip.txt"".<br/><br/>&lt;gossip&gt; X &lt;/gossip&gt;  Save X as gossip.<br/><br/>",A
